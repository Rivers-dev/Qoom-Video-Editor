# Qoom-Video-Editor
A web-based video editor that uses the library FFMPEG/WASM to take two values, a start breakpoint and an end breakpoint, and outputs a new video that has been
trimmed to those breakpoints.

# Usage
It's fairly simple. You enter the two breakpoints in the boxes and hit the trim button, and it does its work. Please note that the scripts (supposedly) only load on
Chrome, though I have observed them to sometimes work on other browsers.
